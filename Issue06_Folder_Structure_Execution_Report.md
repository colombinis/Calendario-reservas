# Issue06_Folder_Structure_Execution_Report.md

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED (Phase 1/2)

## Task Summary
- Created a scalable, LLM-friendly folder structure as defined in Issue #6.
- Added placeholder documentation files for future expansion.
- Created a migration plan for moving existing files into the new structure.

## Execution Overview
- **Attempts Required:** 1/3
- **Total Duration:** < 1 hour
- **Final Validation:** PASSED (structure and docs created; file moves pending manual review)

## Key Deliverables
- New folder structure under `src/`, `tests/`, and `docs/`
- Placeholder documentation files
- Migration plan for moving files

## Validation Results
- All required folders exist
- Documentation files created
- No files deleted or lost

## Lessons Learned

- Manual review is needed for file moves and import updates due to lack of build tooling
- Clear documentation and planning are essential for LLM-friendly, scalable projects
